## Project Overview

**Fox Game** is a Unity-based project that demonstrates core game development mechanics such as character control, physics interactions, animation handling, and simple AI for obstacles or enemies. The goal is to help a fox navigate levels, collect items, and avoid hazards to reach a safe zone.

## Features

* Player movement: walk, run, and jump using keyboard controls.
* Collectibles: items that increase score or grant power-ups.
* Obstacles: simple AI-driven hazards or environmental traps.
* Multiple levels: designed in Unity scenes with increasing difficulty.
* Smooth animations: sprite or model animations for character actions.

## Gameplay

* **Move**: Arrow keys or `A`/`D` (desktop) to move left and right.
* **Jump**: `Space` to jump.
* **Interact**: Approach collectibles to pick them up automatically.
* **Objective**: Collect all items or reach the exit door to progress to the next level.
